It also requires far less computing power and resources to test new approaches, validate others' work, and explore new use cases. Additionally, LLaMA is designed to be versatile and can be applied to many different use cases, and it is released under a noncommercial license focused on research use cases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it hard to use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nNo, it is not hard to use.
